## About Me

Hi! My name is Qirui Long, currently a 2nd year PhD candidate in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical/Space Engineering under the supervision of Prof.Max Zhang at Cornell University. I have been an affiliate of the Energy and the Environment Research Laboratory (EERL) since 2023 with an emphasis on ecosystem services and agricultural modeling for sustainable solar development. I received my B.S. degree from the University of California, Davis, and my M.S. degree from Stanford University.
